## Hi there i'm an aspiring Cyber Security Analyst with a foundation in penetration testing, digital forensics, and network security. Certified in Google Cyber Security and Harvard CS50 Cyber Security, I am passionate about identifying vulnerabilities, securing systems, and analyzing cyber threats.
I have hands-on experience with SIEM tools, Python scripting, Linux Bash, and ethical hacking techniques. Through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and personal cybersecurity projects, I have developed practical skills in network security, incident response, and offensive security testing.
I am constantly learning and expanding my expertise in ethical hacking, OSINT, and security analysis, aiming to contribute to a safer digital world. I am seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world cybersecurity challenges.
Let's connect and secure the future together! ðŸ‘‹
